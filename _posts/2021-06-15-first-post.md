## First shot at this - 

I have constantly picked up things and kept them on for a few months, only to find myself slipping back on them and not even thinking about what it was in the first place. The one thing I found through much research and counselling was accountability. This blog is an effort to keep myself accountable in my actions and also to keep track of my progress in various fields of my life that I want to succeed in, or get better at. I want to go into data science, I genuinely believe that I will one day – but I need to show that to myself, so expect my posts to include anything interesting I find as I dive further into that world. I have been consuming anything to do with discipline and productivity and it would be a lie to say that this blog did not come from the lessons learned there, so whenever I come up with anything good about that field, expect some ramble about it. 

I do also have other interests that might pipe up now and then like film, technology and writing so who knows? With every new post, it will become more routine, and with this routine I will be able to get closer to the life I know I can have.
